This is the source code for my webpage!
You can go and take a look at [neergaard.fi](https://neergaard.fi).

### Tech stack:

* [pugjs](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) for views
* [bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) for CSS
* [nodejs](https://github.com/nodejs/node) for runtime

I wanted to get a bit more into web development, and thought that creating my own site would be the best first option.
I got the idea to use *bulma* by a friend of mine, and it looked pretty nice so I gave it a shot!
As for pug, I had no clue which views generator I should get into, but pug had a good reputation and was a pleasure to work with.
